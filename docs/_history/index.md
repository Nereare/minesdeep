### War of Tears

During this war, two fronts battled: Dragons (with pseudodragons, hordes of devils, some demons, scattered fae, and recently created monstrosities) against Gods (with angels). The recently discovered - but already mastered - Epic Magic the Dragons could wield laid waste to the armies of lesser gods and angels.

The war came to an end when the Greater Gods themselves intervened, now causing vast amounts of death on the Dragons' front and core setlements. The godly destruction, however, was short. After a single day of power display - and thousands of dragons down -, the Greater Gods ceased attacks, offering a ceasefire and opening negotiations with the Dragons.

Dragons harbored a growing resentment towards the Gods for allowing them to die, while Archfae, Fiends, and Angels all were immortal. They thought it unfair to live for no longer than a couple thousand years.

The war ended as the Gods agreed to ascend Dragons to immortalhood as well.

### Hecate

A Greater God born after much of History had happened.

While scholars hold her as **born** from nothing in 1.291 of the Second Draconic Age, some believe her existing since the begining of History, and hiding Herself from even the other Gods up until then.

### Decumvirate

Now immortal, Dragons were faced with an endless life and a renewed breath of civilization.

After the end of the War of Tears, each of the ten draconic subsocieties begin organizing themselves and finding diplomatic ways to find common ground between themselves.

The end result of this was a centralized system of ten monarchies that, each, was consiedered to be as powerful as each other and, as a whole, a single form of macrogovernment formed from each of the heads of each society.
